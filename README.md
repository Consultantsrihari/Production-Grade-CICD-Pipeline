Excited to share a complete CI/CD pipeline I built from scratch, automating the entire workflow from a git push to a live deployment on AWS! 🚀
This project was a deep dive into modern DevOps practices, focusing on creating a robust, repeatable, and efficient software delivery process. When code is pushed to GitHub, the pipeline automatically triggers, ensuring quality and speed.
Key Features & Workflow:
✅ Automated Testing: Jenkins automatically runs unit tests on every commit to catch bugs early.
✅ Dockerization: The Node.js application is packaged into a Docker container for a consistent environment.
✅ Pipeline as Code: The entire CI/CD process is defined in a Jenkinsfile, making it version-controlled and easy to manage.
✅ Automated Deployment: On a successful build, Jenkins securely deploys the new Docker container to an AWS EC2 instance, replacing the old version seamlessly.
Here's the architecture:
Developer ➡️ GitHub (Push) ➡️ Jenkins (Test & Build) ➡️ Docker Image ➡️ AWS EC2 (Deploy)
Tech Stack:
☁️ Cloud: AWS EC2
🔄 CI/CD: Jenkins
🐳 Containerization: Docker
🐙 VCS: GitHub
🟢 Application: Node.js, Express.js
I've documented the entire process, from setting up the AWS infrastructure to writing the Jenkinsfile, in the project's README.

Option 2: The Storyteller / Learning Journey
This version is more personal and focuses on what you learned, which is great for showing a growth mindset.
I wanted to move beyond theory and get my hands dirty with real-world DevOps tools. So, I challenged myself to build a complete CI/CD pipeline from zero. Today, I'm thrilled to share the result!
This project took me on an incredible learning journey through the core components of modern software delivery. I set up servers on AWS, configured Jenkins as my automation engine, containerized an application with Docker, and tied it all together with a Jenkinsfile.
The best moment? Making a one-line code change, pushing it to GitHub, and watching it go live on the web seconds later—all without any manual intervention. It felt like magic! ✨
What I learned:
🔹 The power of "Pipeline as Code" for managing complex workflows.
🔹 The importance of security groups and SSH keys for secure communication between services.
🔹 How Docker simplifies dependencies and creates portable applications.
🔹 The satisfaction of turning a multi-step manual process into a single, automated command: git push.
Tech used: Jenkins, AWS EC2, Docker, GitHub, and Node.js.
I've documented every step in the hope that it can help others on their learning path. You can find the complete guide and code here: [Link to your GitHub Repository]

Option 3: The Quick & Punchy (Great for Mobile)
This is a short, direct, and emoji-heavy post that's easy to read quickly on a mobile feed.
CI/CD in action! ⚡
Just wrapped up a project building a fully automated pipeline.
The Flow:
Code Push ➡️ Tests Run ➡️ Docker Build ➡️ Auto-Deploy
My Stack:
🔧 Jenkins
☁️ AWS EC2
🐳 Docker
